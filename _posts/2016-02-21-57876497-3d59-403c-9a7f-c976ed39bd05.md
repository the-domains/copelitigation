**Overview of Paralegal Services**

• All work is performed under the
direct supervision of the attorney and can be done remotely from my
own office.  

​• I provide paralegal support for
cases in state and federal courts and for out-of-state cases. I understand
and apply state and federal rules of civil and appellate procedures
relevant to each case. My experience encompasses cases in the Utah State District Courts,
Utah Court of Appeals, United States District Court, Tenth Circuit Court
of Appeals, United States Supreme Court, and other jurisdictions outside
of Utah.

• I am the current CLE Chair for the Paralegal
Division of the Utah State Bar and keep informed of rule changes and current eDiscovery trends.

• Discovery phase work
includes gathering and analyzing evidence, responding to
discovery requests, summarizing deposition
transcripts, propounding discovery, and working with clients to
obtain accurate information. 

• I provide comprehensive eDiscovery
management using Ipro Eclipse SE with enhanced search, redaction,
conversion, indexing, and Bates stamping capabilities.

• Pretrial and trial support:
Attend pretrial and motion hearings with attorney
to track deadlines and pretrial orders; manage pretrial
deadlines; maintain effective communication with
clients, opposing counsel, experts, witnesses, and court clerks; manage
exhibits and work with court clerks to record exhibits accepted into
evidence. 

• Jury trial support:
Arrange focus groups and mock trials, assist in voir dire by compiling questionnaires and
evaluating responses; provide real time jury observations, jury polling.

• I take the time to meet with you
and understand the needs of your firm to provide the level of paralegal support
that you need.
